### 3d internet flyers for datafruits events

These are special sites I created to use as flyers for datafruits events.
Although its not the most sophisticated webGL code, I think the idea of using
webGL for an event page is unique.

### Mojogoro release special site

A collaboration with Mojogoro combining Web GL and popups as some kind of website/music video.

### Liquidsoap book

Liquidsoap is an open source stream automation tool. Its very powerful but can
be difficult to learn. I hope this book I am writing will help with that. I
expect to finish the book sometime this Spring.
