<h1>You want to add ember to your rails app, but you aren’t sure what approach
to take and you don’t want to rewrite your entire app. This book will save you
the time by showing you  how to add ember without rewriting the entire
application.</h1>

<h2>You want to make your app feel more modern and interactive. But you live in the real world, full of aging Rails apps that can’t just "sprinkle" in some ember...</h2>

...or can you? Its not as impossible as you might think and the tooling is getting better every day.

This book will save you many hours of googling the right configuration of ember,
which ember data adapter to use, how to format your json, etc. etc. Buy this
book and get on with writing your app.

<h2>You're a Rails developer. You want to stop screwing around with Javascript
 (Javascript?!) and get on with shipping your application.</h2>
Turn your rails application into the interactive modern app that you are dreaming of WITHOUT doing a total rewrite.

Another feature request comes in to add some intense user interactivity to your rails app. Oh no, you think. It’s going to take another gallon of jQuery soup to implement this one.

Why? Why can’t I just use ember like all the cool new projects are?

<h2><i>"I'll never be able to add something like Ember.js to our huge monster
monolithic rails application. It will take weeks or months to re-architect our
application or worse, a full rewrite."</i></h2>

<h3 class="wow">IT DOESN’T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY.</h3> <!-- make this have a funny CSS
animation -->

This book will show you that its not that hard to add some Ember magic to your aging Rails monolith. Thanks to Ember’s design you can take a step-by-step approach. Start small by just adding some components that will get you a lot farther than you imagine. Later move on to using models and even Ember’s router, all without re-writing your rails app.

Your colleagues and boss will think you are a wizard. But you’re not a wizard. Or are you?

Turn your CRUDy rails application into the interactive modern app that you are dreaming of WITHOUT doing a total rewrite.

Maybe you'll even start to like Javascript a little bit.
