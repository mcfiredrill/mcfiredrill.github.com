If you find yourself checking for nil constantly, a null object of some sort can help.

I wanted to make a null object for dates. Here is the NullDate class I came up with.

```
class NullDate
  include Comparable
  def strftime format
    "No date yet."
  end
  def to_s
    "No date yet."
  end
  def <=>(other_date)
    Time.new(0000,1,1) <=> other_date
  end
  def to_datetime
    Time.new(0000,1,1).to_datetime
  end
end
```

I found myself checking for nil all over the place when comparing dates, so I
made my NullDate class implement <=>, and just have it compare to
`Time.new(0000,1,1)`, which is the lowest time/date value possible. Be sure to
implement `to_datetime`, or you'll get an error like this:


Here's an ascii.io screencast I made that demonstrates use of this class!
